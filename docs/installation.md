# DashPi Detailed Installation

## Flashing Raspberry Pi OS 

1. Install the Raspberry Pi Imager from the [official download page](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Insert the target SD Card into your computer and launch the Raspberry Pi Imager software
    - Raspberry Pi Device: Choose your Pi model
    - Operating System: Select **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)**
        - Use the **Lite** image, not the Desktop image. The Lite image saves significant RAM and disk space by excluding the desktop environment, browser, and other unnecessary packages — critical for the Pi Zero 2W's 512 MB of RAM.
    - Storage: Select the target SD Card

3. Click Next and choose Edit Settings on the Use OS customization? screen
    - General:
        - Set hostname: enter your desired hostname
            -  This will be used to ssh into the device & access the DashPi UI on your network.
        - Set username & password
            - Do not use the default username and password on a Raspberry PI as this poses a security risk
        - Configure wireless LAN to your network
            - The DashPi web server will only be accessible to devices on this network
        - Set local settings to your Time zone
    - Service:
        - Enable SSH:
            - Use password authentication

## Installing DashPi

Clone DashPi and run the installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SHagler2/DashPi.git
cd DashPi
sudo bash install/install.sh
```

For a Waveshare e-paper display, install with the Waveshare driver name:

```bash
sudo bash install/install.sh -W epd7in3f
```

The `-W` option downloads the matching Waveshare driver into
`src/display/waveshare_epd/`, installs the e-paper GPIO dependencies, enables
the SPI interface, and writes `"display_type": "epd7in3f"` into
`src/config/device.json`.

If you already installed DashPi without `-W`, you do not need to reinstall from
scratch. Stop the service, download the driver, set `display_type`, verify the
SPI overlay, reboot, and start DashPi again.
